    <H3 id="center">How I Operate</H3>
    Its not easy balancing two school, then again I signed up for it.
    Change is something that seems scary at times, but adaptability is 
    a fundimental function to have in life.
     Growing up ive always beleived that if you really want something
     you need to work for it. Without having the proper mindset and a 
     passion to succeed, you can never accomplish the things that you
     really want. I used to be the oposite of that, so change can happen.<br>

     <span style="color:var(--color-1)">Music--</span> is a key part of my life and alot of the things a do.
     On the way to school, while doing work, when i get home and even in the shower.
     Im always listening to music. My passion for music grew so large, that
     i learned how to play a piano.<br> <img scr="Steinway_Vienna_002.jpeg" alt= "piano" width="100">
     <br> <br> <span style="color:var(--color-1)">Hands on Activities--</span> I have a deep passion or desire to be productive.
     Usually i dont feel like doing much, so i encourage myself to do something productive.
     It isnt easy to randomly remember to finish and assignment or hit the gym. It takes the right
     mind set and strive to complete what you want to do. With that being said i absolutely love
     helping people, like carying bags or helping someone with an assignment. I also like engaging
     in sports and or board games, because it works your brain.
